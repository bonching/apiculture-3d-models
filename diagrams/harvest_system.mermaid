    A[Begin: Robot enters the beehive] --> B[Trigger smoker]
    B --> P[Move slider and rotate tube to scan beehive interior from all angles]
    P --> D[Transmit captured images to the server for analysis]
    D --> E[Computer vision AI agent analyzes images to identify honeypots]
    E --> F[Generate a list of 3D honeypot coordinates]
    F --> G{Are there any coordinates in the list?}
    G -- No --> H[Choose the next coordinate from the list]
    H --> I[Provide coordinate and other environment state to AI agent]
    I --> J[AI creates instructions for slider movement, tube rotation, and syringe extension]
    J --> L[Robot executes instructions to pinch the honeypot]
    L --> M[Execute the honey extraction program]
    M --> N[Delete coordinate from list]
    N --> G
    G -- Yes --> O[Measure harvested honey then send activity logs to the server]
    O --> Q[Finish: Robot exits the beehive]
